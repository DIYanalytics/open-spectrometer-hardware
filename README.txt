AUTHOR
Alessandro Volpato created the design files and the software found in this folder / repository.
The work was done by merging concepts of the Public Lab spectrometer, (https://publiclab.org/notes/abdul/10-13-2016/desktop-spectrometry-starter-kit-3-0-instructions)
from the GaudiLabs spectrometer (http://www.gaudi.ch/GaudiLabs/?page_id=328) and adding new design features to improve the user experience by simplifying the assembly and  

HARDWARE
The spectrometer consists of a set of materials designed to be available and affordable to buy from everywhere in the world, assuming no specific legal import barriers are being established for the buyers country. The design's focus is to promote education about spectrometry and analytical chemistry, with the goal of empowering, stimulating and encouraging individuals to inquiry their environment applying scientific methodologies. Besides, the tool is perfect to study open design, scientific programming, physics and reflect about reproducibility in scientific practices.

SOFTWARE
The spectrometer is compatible with the software provided by Public Lab: the Spectral Workbench, at www.spectralworkbench.org
The author encourages to visit the website and share the results with the Public Lab's community.

The author provides (not released yet) a simple python script to allow the user to visualize the data, plot the results and have a deeper insight about the sensor reads, calibration and the mathematical processes behind spectroscopic analysis.

DOCUMENTATION (not released yet)
The documentation leads the user through the process of assembling the spectrometer and calibrating it.
Each of these two processes is documented in a separate guide

KNOWN "TO DO" IMPROVEMENTS
- improve the design of the wooden part holding the camera
- redesign the light side, in order to allow CFL light coming in without disassembling the whole spectrometer
- write a script that allows the user to control the spactrometer with a simple offline device
- reduce the size to fit in one 25x50cm board
